Intro 12/8/2022: Today's version is still unfortunately largely  unfinished. I realized my project would take a lot longer to fully complete in terms of content. I was able to establish a lot of the base logic such as movement, collisions, interaction with the dialogue box/menu/canvas, as well as how to make/find my relevant assets like the map I built. But there is still a lot more content I need to push into my game, partly due to the nature of my game being an RPG driven by plot. 

Instructions: As a member of Team Rocket, you find yourself lost and separated from your crew after being blasted into space yet again. When you wake up, you find a friendly Bagon by your side. You realize that if you evolve this Bagon, you can use them to fly back home! 

GOAL: Evolve Bagon by finding ways to increase your friendship level! You can check friendship level with the pokedex on the menu.

Controls: Use WASD to move, use your mouse to interact with things on screen.
